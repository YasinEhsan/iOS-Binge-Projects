# Problem-Driven Projects
## Zave

Overall 2nd place from 40+ teams part of the 12-week iOS bootcamp trained by lead teams in San Francisco. [CodePath Bootcamp](https://codepath.org/)

STACK: Swift, Google Cloud, Zeplin design. <br/> <br/>

- **Problem** We frequently crave a premium travel experience offered by ride-sharing apps but we are going broke.

- **Solution** Zave connects ride-share users to split Uber/Lyft at metro price by connecting local ride-shares with shared destinations.

- **Iteration** Create an algorithm that finds the the midpoint meetup place between shared commuters. This way no rider feels like they are doing more "work" than the others.

## Alamo
Overall top 10 from 550+ Capital One Software Engineering Interns competing in a hackathon during onboarding week. Built using Swift and Python(Flask), SQLite and Zeplin design.<br/> <br/>

- **Problem** In a world of scale and a battle of margins, small cash businesses are taking the biggest hits with credit card minimums or ATM fees for customer withdrawals.

- **Solution** Connect to trade cash(providers) for Venmo(requesters) w/o any fees.

- **Iteration** Increase reliability that both parties deliver by building a credit-score-like system.

# Debug
- error: SWIFT_VERSION '5.0' is unsupported, supported versions are: 3.0, 4.0, 4.2._  
    - Fix : .xcw workspace > blue pod/proj file > build settings > swift lang > change to 4.2 or desirable
- error: Multiple commands produce_
    - Fix : Open target > Build phases > Copy Bundle Resources and remove info.plist from there.


# Git
## Branch + Merge
- **Create Branch:** "git checkout ____" creates subbranch from current head
- I am calling the sub-branch's origin branch parent. It could be called master, feature/..., releases, etc
- Parent branches shouldn't be tweaked while work is being done in subbranch
- **Merge Branch:** "git checkout" to parent branch. And then "git Merge" with the branch you currently working on. This merges the working branch with the parent branch. Afterwards checkout to working branch and merge with parent. The order is important.
- In the network graphics, working branches should be ahead of main branch before any merging. After merging, all tags should align with parent branch being a straight line all along branching process.
- In between each stage of merge/checkouts make sure to git pull.
- Also, do the merges from child's editor's computer for iOS projects. This gives us an option to 86 that branch without having to redo the project if there are any serious .plist / pod / XML merge conflicts.


## Local to Global first-time setup
- git config --list (checks current git account)
- git config -- global user.name " "
- git config -- global user.email " "
- some others pre-reqs: SSH for alternate to https and GPG keys for verified git commits
- git init
- echo "#repo-name" > README.md
- git commit -am" "
- create the git repo online WITHOUT a README. Then copy the code from the section that reads: **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**
- git push (-u origin master)
